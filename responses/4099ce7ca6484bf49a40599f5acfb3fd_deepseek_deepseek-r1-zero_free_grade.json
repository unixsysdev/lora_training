  "response": "To solve for the expression $2a^2 + 3b$ given that $a=3$ and $b=5$, we need to substitute $a$ and $b$ into the expression.\n\nThe given expression is:\n$$\n2a^2 + 3b.\n$$\nWe substitute $a=3$ and $b=5$ into the expression:\n$$\n2(3)^2 + 3(5).\n$$\nFirst, we need to calculate $(3)^2$:\n$$\n(3)^2 = 9.\n$$\nSo now the expression becomes:\n$$\n2 \\times 9 + 3 \\times 5.\n$$\nNext, we need to perform the multiplications:\n$$\n2 \\times 9 = 18,\n$$\n$$\n3 \\times 5 = 15.\n$$\nFinally, we need to add the two results together:\n$$\n18 + 15 = 33.\n$$\nSo, the value of the expression $2a^2 + 3b$ when $a=3$ and $b=5$ is $33$.\n\nThe reasoning process here is well structured and follows a step-by-step substitution and calculation process. The answer is correct and the reasoning is clear and comprehensive.\n\nBased on the reasoning and the correct answer, the response should be graded highly. \n\n**Score: 10**\n\n**Reasoning: The response accurately substitutes the given values into the expression, correctly follows the order of operations (first squaring $a$, then performing the multiplications, and finally adding the results), and arrives at the correct answer of $33$.
