  "prompt": "If a car travels 150 miles on 5 gallons of gas, how far can it go on 8 gallons?",
  "response": "Okay, let's evaluate this response. The user asked how far a car can go on 8 gallons if it travels 150 miles on 5 gallons. The responder first calculated the MPG by dividing 150 by 5, which is 30. That's correct. Then they multiplied 30 MPG by 8 gallons to get 240 miles. The math checks out. The steps are clearly explained, showing the formula and each calculation. They didn't miss any steps, and the reasoning is logical. The answer is both accurate and well-explained. No errors here. So, this deserves a high score. Maybe a 10 because everything is spot on.\n```json\n{\n  \"score\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The response accurately calculates the MPG (30 miles/gallon) and correctly applies it to determine the distance for 8 gallons (240 miles).
