  "prompt": "If a triangle has sides of lengths 3, 4, and 5, what is its area?",
  "response": "\\boxed{\n  \"score\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The reasoning process correctly uses Heron's formula to find the area of a triangle with sides of lengths 3, 4, and 5. The semi-perimeter is correctly calculated as 6, and Heron's formula is applied correctly to find that the area is 6 square units. An alternative check verifies that the triangle is a right triangle (since $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$), and the area is also verified using the formula for the area of a right triangle (1/2 * base * height), which also results in an area of 6 square units. The reasoning is clear, comprehensive, and accurate.\"\n}",
