  "response": "To solve the system of equations:\n1) 2x + y = 7\n2) 3x - 2y = 8\n\nWe can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the elimination method first.\n\n**Elimination Method:**\n\nOur goal is to eliminate one of the variables by making their coefficients opposites or the same in both equations. In this case, it's easier to eliminate 'y'. Notice that the coefficient of 'y' in the first equation is 1 and in the second equation is -2. We can",
