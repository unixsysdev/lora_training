  "prompt": "If a square has a perimeter of 20 cm, what is its area?",
  "response": "\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The prompt is asking for the area of a square, given that its perimeter is 20 cm.\n\n2. To find the area, we need to know the length of one side of the square. We can find this by dividing the perimeter by 4 (since a square has 4 equal sides).\n\n3. Perimeter = 20 cm\n\n   Side length = Perimeter / 4 = 20 cm / 4 = 5 cm\n\n4. Now that we know the side length, we can find the area by squaring it:\n\n   Area = Side length × Side length = 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 cm²\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 25 cm².",
