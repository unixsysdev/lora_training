  "prompt": "What is 15% of 240?",
  "response": "\n\nSure, I'd be happy to help! To find 15% of 240, we can follow these steps:\n1. Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 15% = 0.15\n2. Multiply the decimal by the number: 0.15 x 240 = 36\nSo, 15% of 240 is 36.\nHere's the reasoning behind this calculation:\n* When we convert a percentage to a decimal, we are essentially dividing by 100. This is because a percentage is a fraction of 100. For example, 15% is the same as 15/100 or 0.15.\n* Multiplying the decimal by the number gives us the result of the percentage. In this case, 0.15 x 240 = 36, which means that 15% of 240 is 36.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
