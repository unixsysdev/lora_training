  "prompt": "A rectangle has a length of 12 cm and a width of 8 cm. What is its area?",
  "response": "\n\nSure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1. The prompt is asking for the area of a rectangle with a length of 12 cm and a width of 8 cm.\n\n2. To find the area of a rectangle, we need to multiply its length by its width.\n\n3. So, the area of the rectangle is:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n\n= 12 cm x 8 cm\n\n= 96 cm^2\n\n4. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 96 square centimeters.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
