  "response": "\n\nTo simplify the expression (2x³y²)/(4xy) when x = 2 and y = 3, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Substitute the given values of x and y into the expression:\n\n(2(2)³(3)²)/(4(2)(3))\n\n2. Simplify the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator: 2(2)³(3)² = 2(8)(9) = 144\n\nDenominator: 4(2)(3) = 24\n\n3. Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\n144/24 = 6\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression (2x³y²)/(4xy) when x = 2 and y = 3 is 6.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We start by substituting the given values of x and y into the expression. This allows us to evaluate the expression with specific values.\n\n2. In the numerator, we have 2x³y². We substitute x = 2 and y = 3, which gives us 2(2)³(3)². Simplifying this, we get 2(8)(9) = 144.\n\n3. In the denominator, we have 4xy. Substituting x = 2 and y = 3, we get 4(2)(3) = 24.\n\n4. Finally, we divide the numerator (144) by the denominator (24) to get the simplified expression, which is 6.\n\nBy following these steps, we can simplify the given expression and obtain the result of 6 when x = 2 and y = 3.",
