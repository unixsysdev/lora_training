  "response": "To solve for the value of $\\tan(45^\\circ)$, we need to recall the well-known trigonometric identity for the tangent of a $45^\\circ$ angle. \n\nThe angle $45^\\circ$ is a well-known angle where the sine and cosine values are equal. Specifically, we know that:\n$$\n\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\n$$\nHowever, the tangent function is defined as the ratio of the sine function to the cosine function:\n$$\n\\tan(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sin(45^\\circ)}{\\cos(45^\\circ)}.\n$$\nSince we already established that $\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$:\n$$\n\\tan(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sin(45^\\circ)}{\\cos(45^\\circ)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1.\n$$\nAnother way to directly recall the value is by memorizing the standard trigonometric values for $45^\\circ$:\n$$\n\\tan(45^\\circ) = 1.\n$$\nThis is a well-known result that is usually memorized from a table of trigonometric values for common angles such as $0^\\circ$, $30^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $90^\\circ$.\n\nBased on the reasoning process, the answer is correct and well-explained. The reasoning is clear and comprehensive, and the answer is accurate.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the response should be graded as follows:\n\n{\n  \"score\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The response correctly identifies that tan(45°) is equal to 1. The reasoning is well-explained by using the fact that in a 45°-45°-90° triangle, the legs are equal, so the tangent of 45° (which is the ratio of the opposite leg to the adjacent leg) is 1. Another part of the reasoning also correctly uses the identity tan(θ) = sin(θ) / cos(θ) where sin(45°) = cos(45°) = √2/2, thus tan(45°) = 1. The answer is accurate, clear, and well-reasoned.\"\n}\n\\boxed{\n  \"score\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The response correctly identifies that tan(45°) is equal to 1.
