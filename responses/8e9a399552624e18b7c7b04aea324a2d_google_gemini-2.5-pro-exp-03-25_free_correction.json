  "prompt": "If 3x + 5 = 20, what is the value of x?",
  "response": "Okay, let's solve the equation 3x + 5 = 20 step-by-step to find the value of x.\n\n**1. Goal:** Our aim is to isolate the variable 'x' on one side of the equation.\n\n**2. Subtract 5 from both sides:** To start isolating the term with 'x' (which is 3x), we need to get rid of the constant term (+5) on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation to maintain the balance:\n   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5\n   3x = 15\n\n**3. Divide both sides by 3:** Now, 'x' is being multiplied by 3. To isolate 'x', we perform the inverse operation, which is dividing by 3. We divide both sides by 3:\n   (3x) / 3 = 15 / 3\n   x = 5\n\n**4. Check the answer (optional but recommended):** Substitute the value x = 5 back into the original equation to make sure it's correct:\n   3(5) + 5 = 20\n   15 + 5 = 20\n   20 = 20\n   The equation holds true.\n\n**Therefore, the value of x is 5.**",
