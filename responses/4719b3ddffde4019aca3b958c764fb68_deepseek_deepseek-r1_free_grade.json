  "prompt": "If 4(x + 3) = 28, what is x?",
  "response": "Okay, let's evaluate this response. The user asked to solve 4(x + 3) = 28 for x and to show the work. The response provided a step-by-step solution.\n\nFirst, they started with the original equation. Then divided both sides by 4, which is correct because it's the inverse operation of multiplication. That simplifies to x + 3 = 7. Next, they subtracted 3 from both sides, leading to x = 4. All steps are mathematically accurate and follow proper algebraic principles. Each step is clearly explained, making it easy to follow. The answer is correct, and the reasoning is solid. There's no confusion or errors in the process. The use of LaTeX formatting for equations also enhances clarity. However, the response could be slightly more concise, but that's minor. All necessary steps are present. So, this deserves a high score.\n```json\n{\n  \"score\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The response accurately solves the equation with clear, step-by-step explanations.
