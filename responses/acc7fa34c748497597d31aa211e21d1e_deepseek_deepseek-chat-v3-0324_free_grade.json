However, the instruction to graph the solution on a coordinate plane is unnecessary and not part of the original prompt, which detracts from the focus. The response also abruptly shifts to a much more complex problem (deriving the quadratic formula) without completing it, which is confusing and irrelevant to the original prompt. The score reflects the accurate solution to the given problem but penalizes the unnecessary and incomplete additional content.\"\n}\n```",
