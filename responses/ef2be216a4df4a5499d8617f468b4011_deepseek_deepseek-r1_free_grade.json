  "prompt": "If a shirt originally costs $40 and is on sale for 30% off, what is the sale price?",
  "response": "Okay, let's evaluate this response. The user asked for the sale price of a shirt that's $40 with 30% off. The response correctly calculates the discount by converting 30% to 0.30 and multiplying by $40, which gives $12. Then they subtract that from the original price to get $28. That's accurate. The steps are clear and easy to follow. They explained each part, so it's comprehensive. The reasoning is solid, no mistakes here. Maybe they could have mentioned alternative methods, like finding 70% of $40 directly, but the answer is correct as is. So, I'd give a 10.\n```json\n{\n  \"score\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The response accurately calculates the 30% discount ($12) and correctly subtracts it from the original price ($40) to arrive at the correct sale price ($28).
