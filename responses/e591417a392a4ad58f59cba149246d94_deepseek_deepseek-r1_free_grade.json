  "response": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a math problem where a = 3 and b = 5, and they need to find 2a² + 3b. The response given breaks down each step clearly.\n\nFirst, substituting the values: 2*(3)² + 3*(5). Then calculating the square of 3, which is 9. Multiplying that by 2 gives 18. Then 3 times 5 is 15. Adding 18 and 15 gives 33. All the steps are correct and in the right order. The explanation is thorough, easy to follow, and there's no mistake in the arithmetic. The final answer is correct. The response is both accurate and well-explained. So, this deserves a high score. Maybe a 10 because there's nothing wrong here.\n```json\n{\n  \"score\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The response correctly substitutes the given values into the expression, accurately performs each arithmetic operation step-by-step, and arrives at the correct final answer.
