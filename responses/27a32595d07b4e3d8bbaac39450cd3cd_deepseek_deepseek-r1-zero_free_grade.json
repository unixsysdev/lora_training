  "response": "\\boxed{\n  \"score\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The response correctly calculates that Jane spends $18 (2/5 of $45) and thus has $27 left. Another valid reasoning is also provided where it is shown that spending 2/5 means she has 3/5 of her money left, which is also correctly calculated as $27. The reasoning is clear and the answer is correct.\"\n}",
