The derivative of the constant -7 is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\n\nPutting it all together, the derivative of the given function is:\n\n\ndy/dx = 3x² - 8x + 2.\n\n\nThis is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point x on the function y = x³ - 4x² + 2x - 7.", "tokens": 160, "timestamp": 1745006846.6439397}

{"prompt": "A boat travels upstream at 8 mph and downstream at 12 mph. What is the speed of the current?", "qid": "91d4ce473e5343bcb4b35f2349c48a70", "answer": "\n\n# Answer\n\nTo determine the speed of the current, we need to understand that the boat's speed in still water (without the current) and the speed of the current are two different factors that affect the boat' precipitation speed.\n\nWhen the boat is going upstream (against the current), its effective speed is reduced by the speed of the current. When it's going downstream (with the current), its effective speed is increased by the speed of the current.\n\nLet's denote the speed of the boat in still water as \\( V_b \\) and the speed of the current as \\( V_c \\).\n\nGiven:\n- The boat's upstream speed (against the current) is 8 mph.\n- The boat's downstream speed (with the current) is 12 mph.\n\nWe can set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1. When going upstream, the boat's speed is reduced by the current's speed:\n\\[ V_b - V_c = 8 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\n2. When going downstream, the boat's speed is increased by the current's speed:\n\\[ V_b + V_c = 12 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for \\( V_c \\) by adding the two equations together to eliminate \\( V_b \\):\n\n\\[ (V_b - V_c) + (V_b + V_c) = 8 + 12 \\]\n\\[ 2V_b = 20 \\]\n\\[ V_b = 10 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( V_b \\), we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for \\( V_c \\). Let's use the first equation:\n\n\\[ 10 - V_c = 8 \\]\n\\[ V_c = 10 - 8 \\]\n\\[ V_c = 2 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of the current is 2 mph.", "tokens": 292, "timestamp": 1745006872.2348924}
